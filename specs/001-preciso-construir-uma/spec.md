# Feature Specification: NPM Package Malware Analysis System

**Feature Branch**: `001-preciso-construir-uma`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Preciso construir uma aplica√ß√£o de an√°lise de malware utilizando LLM para pacotes do Node.js no NPM e similares. O objetivo √© realizar an√°lises que ajudem a identificar as melhores depend√™ncias para o meu projeto, evitando problemas nas minhas aplica√ß√µes."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to evaluate the security and quality of NPM packages before adding them as dependencies to their project. They need to analyze packages for potential malware, suspicious code patterns, and overall reliability to make informed decisions about which dependencies are safe to use in their applications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has a package name or package.json file, **When** they request analysis of NPM packages, **Then** the system provides security assessment and risk scoring for each package
2. **Given** the system has analyzed a package, **When** potential security issues are detected, **Then** detailed reports with specific concerns and recommendations are provided
3. **Given** a developer needs to choose between multiple packages with similar functionality, **When** they request comparative analysis, **Then** the system ranks packages by security score and provides justification for recommendations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a package has no previous analysis data or is newly published?
- How does the system handle packages with complex dependency trees?
- What occurs when analysis reveals critical security vulnerabilities?
- How does the system respond to packages that are no longer maintained?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze NPM packages for potential malware and security vulnerabilities
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate security risk scores for analyzed packages  
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide detailed analysis reports explaining identified security concerns
- **FR-004**: System MUST analyze package dependencies recursively for comprehensive security assessment
- **FR-005**: System MUST recommend safer alternative packages when security issues are found
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to input package names or upload package.json files for analysis
- **FR-007**: System MUST compare multiple packages and rank them by security and quality metrics
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify suspicious code patterns using AI/LLM analysis
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide analysis results in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: output format not specified - JSON, PDF report, web interface?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST store analysis results for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention period not specified]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle analysis requests within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirements not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support analysis of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which package registries beyond NPM - PyPI, RubyGems, etc.?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Package**: Represents an NPM package with metadata (name, version, description, maintainer information)
- **Analysis Report**: Contains security assessment, risk score, identified vulnerabilities, and recommendations for a specific package
- **Dependency Tree**: Hierarchical structure of package dependencies and their security status
- **Security Alert**: Specific security issue or vulnerability found in a package with severity level and description
- **Alternative Recommendation**: Suggested safer package alternatives with justification and comparison metrics
